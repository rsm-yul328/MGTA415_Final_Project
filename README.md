Emotions play a crucial role in human communication, and understanding emotions from text data has numerous applications in fields. We focus on emotion classification, exploring multiple text representation methods, and evaluate models. These analyses not only help in understanding human emotions from text but also enable applications in sentiment analysis, mental monitoring, and customer feedback evaluation. In this work, we perform emotion classification using NLP techniques to predict the emotions expressed in text-based data.
